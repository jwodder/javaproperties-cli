Read & write Java .properties files

``javaproperties`` provides support for reading & writing Java ``.properties``
files (both the simple line-oriented format and XML) with a simple API based on
the ``json`` module â€” though, for recovering Java addicts, it also includes a
``Properties`` class intended to match the behavior of Java 8's
``java.net.Properties`` as much as is Pythonically possible.

Also included are three command-line programs for basic manipulation of
``.properties`` files (getting & setting values, etc.) as well as converting to
& from the much more widely-supported JSON format.
