==============================================================
javaproperties — Read & write Java .properties files in Python
==============================================================

`javaproperties` provides support for reading & writing Java |properties|_
files (both the simple line-oriented format and XML) with a simple API based on
the `json` module — though, for recovering Java addicts, it also includes a
`Properties` class intended to match the behavior of |java8properties|_ as much
as is Pythonically possible.

Also included are three command-line programs for basic manipulation of
``.properties`` files (getting & setting values, etc.) as well as converting to
& from the much more widely-supported JSON format.

.. note::

    Throughout the following, "text string" means a Unicode character string —
    |unicode|_ in Python 2, `str` in Python 3.
